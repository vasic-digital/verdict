# AGENTS.md — verdict

Carrier read by Codex / Cursor / Aider / OpenCode / Crush / Kimi CLI. One of
the four governance carriers §11.4.157 requires to be maintained in lockstep;
everything below the next heading is byte-identical across all four.

## INHERITED FROM constitution/CLAUDE.md

**The inheritance below is conditional. Both cases are stated; neither is
assumed.**

When this module is consumed inside a project that includes the Helix
Constitution submodule, the rules in `constitution/CLAUDE.md` — and in the
`constitution/Constitution.md` it references — are authoritative for every
topic not covered here. The module-local rules below extend them; they never
weaken or override them.

When this module is consumed standalone — cloned on its own, with no
constitution reachable in any parent — there is nothing to inherit, and **only
the module-local rules below apply**.

### Locating the base file: a resolver, never a path

`constitution/CLAUDE.md` above is the **canonical name** of the base file,
written as the constitution's own examples write it. It is not a filesystem
path relative to this module and must not be rewritten into one: a consuming
project may mount the constitution at `constitution/` or at
`submodules/constitution/`, and this module cannot know which. Resolve it by
walking parents:

```bash
bash "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/submodules/constitution/find_constitution.sh" 2>/dev/null \
  || bash "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/constitution/find_constitution.sh" 2>/dev/null \
  || echo "standalone — no constitution in scope"
```

Read the canonical text on demand, never eagerly: the corpus is large, and a
native `@import` would load it into every session before any work begins.

## What this module is

A three-valued result type for Go — `ok` / `problem` /
`undetermined` — whose numeric value is the process exit code. It exists so
that "could not determine" is never reported as a pass or as a failure. See
[README.md](README.md).

**It is project-not-aware, and that is enforced rather than promised.** It is a
separate Go module, so it does not require any consumer and no consumer-shaped
symbol can appear here even by accident. The test suite asserts it.

## Module-local rules

These extend the inherited rules; they never weaken them.

1. **No consumer-shaped symbol, ever.** No type, field, constant or fixture may
   name a concept belonging to a consuming application. If a consumer needs
   something expressed here, it is expressed in this module's own generic
   vocabulary or it stays in the consumer.

2. **Fixtures are synthetic.** This repository is public. No fixture may
   contain material derived from any private corpus, any real recording, any
   real transcript, or any identifiable person's name or speech. Synthetic
   test data only — no exceptions, and no "it is only a test file".

3. **Dependencies are load-bearing or absent.** Every `require` line must
   justify itself in the `go.mod` comment block. Convenience is not a
   justification: every consumer inherits whatever this module requires.

4. **Gates ship with paired mutations (§1.1).** A gate is not trusted until a
   mutation has been observed to make it fail. A gate that cannot fail is
   unvalidated instrumentation, not a gate.

5. **The three-valued distinction is never collapsed.** "Could not determine"
   is neither a pass nor a failure. Any code path that folds it into either is
   a defect, regardless of how convenient the two-valued read would be.

6. **No CI workflow files.** Per §11.4.156 this repository ships no active
   server-side CI. Gates run locally and at the consuming project's seams.

7. **Never force-push** (§11.4.113). Integrate by merging onto the latest
   `main`; a fast-forward push then always succeeds and no commit is lost.

## Build and test

```bash
go build ./...
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
```

## Upstreams

Mirrored, and both are pushed on every publish (§2.1):

- `git@github.com:vasic-digital/verdict.git`
- `git@gitlab.com:vasic-digital/verdict.git`

Recipes are in `upstreams/`; run `install_upstreams` from the repository
root after cloning (§11.4.36).
